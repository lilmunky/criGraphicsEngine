This is the corpse of a project which was aimed at creating a graphics engine for research purposes.
The main goal was to learn how to use directX, but half of the effort has been put in dealing with the winuser window framework.
This includes a (badly written) logger, a window class which supports having different instances alive together, the directX related part which only draws a triangle (but is ready for more).
The project is discontinued, but feel free to use any part of it you might find useful.
